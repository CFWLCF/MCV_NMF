# MCV_NMF
This is a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with minimum correlation and minimum volume constrains, i.e., the MCV_NMF algorithm. It is proposed for anti-collision application in underde-termined RFID systems. This algorithm combines the independent principle of the tag signals with the NMF mechanism to achieve performance enhancement.The experimental results and analysis corroborate that this new algorithm can implement the underdetermined collision problem well and enhance the throughput capacity of RFID system.
